# Reflective Journal - Day 2- Software Development Final Project

## Overview

After first meeting yesterday I was tasked with setting up our environment for managing the project and creating the Team Contract. 

## Project Description

Team DDT - MERN Stack Web App for Solar Panel Company focusing on a Stock Inventory system.

## Progress Made
- Create first draft of contract
- Initialised collaboration + communication
    - Github
    - Trello
    - Teams Channel with Tutor


## Challenges Faced

- Deciding on method for Scrum, previously in groups it was quite unstructured and often I had to take charge. I wanted to make this project more agile and Me and Mariano will share Scrum Master role depending on agenda and who is more appropriate at the time. So important to make a template of meetings so we are alligned and consistant.

## Next Steps

- Set Agenda for first Scrum meeting on Monday. 
- Develop plan for Scrum Meetings
- Finalize contract
- Discuss Client Meeting

Looking forward to kicking the project into action next week.
