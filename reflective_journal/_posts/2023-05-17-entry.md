## Progress Made

- Class- Given some more resources and discussed boilerplate
- Came up with Elicitation for next client meeting to acquire a full knowledge of the business and their requirements.

## Challenges Faced

- Scrums to be led by Mariano, intrepedation the plan was followed. It was exemplary so gives confidence in our method for the rest of project. 
- Felt like a wasted day as we are kind of waiting on client to complete our proposal that we are eager to do to start the development.
- In class was told about boilerplate bit off putting as wasn't in the plan nor had any experience with, so something to research and learn.


## Next Steps

- Wait on Client Meeting to organize our kick off meeting
- Research MERN stack
- Watch class links
- Set up Planning Document 

Super pleased Scrums went well with someone else as scrum master. Though the rest of the day felt wasted.
